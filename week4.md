## Introduction: Meet Node2020
Node.js, "[a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://nodejs.org/en/)," is a [popular open source project](https://nodesource.com/blog/enterprise-node-js-adoption-increases/) with an active, vibrant development community and a rich, [decade-long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).

But what if the project were launching today? And what if Node.js creator Ryan Dahl sought advice from Group 2 of Brandeis University's Open Source Workflow and Infrastructure course as he established a infrastructural foundation that best ensured the project's success and sustainability?

What might the Node.js project look like if it launched *tomorrow*?

Call it Node2020. Here's how we'd recommend architecting it.

## Priorities and parameters
Our infrastructural recommendations aim to respect the following project priorities and parameters.

**Respect foundation-backed governance.** The Node.js project's [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js#History) is complicated and winding. But it culminates in an interseting [hybrid governance model](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/guide-to-open-source-project-governance-models-overview) that features support from a sponsoring foundation, the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/). Node.js features twin governing bodies: the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md), ulimate arbiter of Node.js overseeing business, legal, and technical aspects of the project, and the [Community Committee (CommComm)](https://nodejs.org/en/about/community/), which oversees implementation of the TSC's decisions regarding both technical and non-technical aspects of the project. Each of these groups establishes its own [initiatives](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee#contributing) and [priorities](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/Strategic-Initiatives.md). Participants select the initiatives to which they'd like to contribute, forming ad-hoc working groups on a largely ad-hoc basis. Infrastructural recommendations for Node2020 take this governance model for granted.

**Maintain the liberal contribution model.** Node.js prides itself on its "[liberal contribution model](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951)." This model—more like a guiding spirit or project ethos—ensures continual infusion of new contributors to Node.js, and is critical to ensuring project health and longevity. Node.js considers anyone who so much as comments on an outstanding project issue, opens a pull request, or participates in a conversation to be a project "[Contributor](https://nodejs.org/en/about/community/)." Becoming a contributor is the first step toward occupying additional roles (which grant additional permissions) in Node.js. Project infrastructure for Node2020 should sustain this spirit of liberal contribution, eliminanting potential hurdles to participation wherever possible.

## Infrastructural recommendations
Our recommendations distinguish between infrastructural components that accomplish both technical and social ends. Any successful open source *project* requires tooling that facilitates distributed collaboration on technical work; any successful open source *community* requires tooling that facilitates communicating about work, coordinating efforts, sharing accomplishments, and recruiting new contributors.
