# Final project



## Introduction: Meet Node2020
Node.js, "[a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://nodejs.org/en/)," is a popular open source project with an active, vibrant development community and a rich, [decade-long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).

And what if Node.js creator Ryan Dahl sought advice from Group 2 of Brandeis University's Open Source Workflow and Infrastructure course as he established a infrastructural foundation that best ensurecd the project's success? What might the Node.js project look like if it launched *tomorrow*?

Call it Node2020. Here's what we'd recommend.
